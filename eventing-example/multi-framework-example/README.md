# Multiple Node Eventing Example

This example runs the light bulb, sensor and smart behaviour on multiple nodes.


## Components

There are three frameworks in the multiple node test. 

Each framework is connected together using OSGi Remote Services (Aries RSA TCP distribution + topology + ZooKeeper discovery)

The nodes are:

 * The Light Bulb Framework
 * The Sensor Framework
 * The Security Light Smart Behaviour

All nodes must be running for the example to function properly

## UIs

The lightbulb UI is at http://localhost:8082/light-ui/index.html

The sensor UI is at http://localhost:8081/sensor-ui/index.html


## Example Flow

Overall flow:

1. Events are created by the sensor when the button is clicked 
2. Sensor events are consumed by the smart behaviour and used to set the light state
3. Light events are generated by the smart behaviour
4. Light events are consumed by the light bulb
